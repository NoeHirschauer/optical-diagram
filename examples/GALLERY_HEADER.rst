This section contains examples of how to use the library to create optical diagrams. 

They do not contain "realistic" setups, but rather are meant to demonstrate the features
of the library and give some ideas of how to use it. 

The sub-sections beginning with "Test" (after the initial examples just below this text)
are not meant to be detailed explanations of how to use the library, but rather to check
that the elements are displayed correctly, especially when they are transformed (rotated,
flipped, etc.). They still demonstrate some of the features of the library.
