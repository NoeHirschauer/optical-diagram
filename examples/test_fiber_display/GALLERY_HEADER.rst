Test Fiber Display
==================

Examples in this section test the display of fiber elements. They are not meant to be
very detailed explanations of how to use the library, but rather to check that the 
elements are displayed correctly, especially when they are transformed (rotated, flipped,
etc.).

They still demonstrate some of the features of the library.

If you see any blatant issue with the display of fiber elements, please report it by
creating an issue on the GitHub repository
